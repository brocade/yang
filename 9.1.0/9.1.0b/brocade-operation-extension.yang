          Clears the extension configuration on the extension switch
          or blade.

          Note that the config-clear operation may be disruptive.
            For extension switches, you must reboot the switch after the
            config-clear operation; otherwise, configuration operations
            are blocked.
            For extension blades, you must power off the blade before you
            clear the slot's corresponding configuration.

            For extension switches, the extension switch reboots automatically

            For extension blades, make sure the blade is in an online state
            for the default-config operation. You may need to power off and on
            the blade slot to apply different extension modes correctly.

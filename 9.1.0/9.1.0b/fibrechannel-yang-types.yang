      Definition of an empty string. This typedef is to be used within a union
      with other data types that cannot be modified to accommodate an empty
      string. The primary use case would be a node that utilizes a
      non-modifiable IETF typedef that does not account for an empty response.

      This type typedef should not be used on its own outside of a union.

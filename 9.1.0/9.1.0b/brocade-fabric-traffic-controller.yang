    Fabric Traffic Controller (FTC) acts as a central point of processing to
    translate Fabric Performance Impacts (FPI) into notifications and
    signaling to end devices throughout the Fabric. Signals and notifications
    are used to communicate the type and relative severity of impacting
    behaviors to the affected members of the Fabric. FTC records information
    regarding diagnostic ELS registration, FPI conditions, and related
    statistics; storing the information per device (per N_Port).

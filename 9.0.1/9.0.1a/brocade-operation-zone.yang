          Use this action type to expunge a zone object. In addition to
          deleting the object, the expunge operation will also remove the
          object from the member lists of all other objects. Expunge
          operations can be performed on cfgs, zones, aliases, WWNs,
          or 'D,I' members.

          This action stages the modifications in the defined-configuration.
          For the staged modifications to become persistent, the user must
          save the changes using one of the following brocade-zone module
          leafs that reside under the effective-configuration container:

             'cfg-action': Specify a '1' to save the pending changes.
             'cfg-name':   Specify the name of configuration to become enabled.

          It is recommended that the save be performed within the configured
          fabric-lock-timeout duration specified in the
          brocade-fibrechannel-configuration module under the
          zone-configuration container.

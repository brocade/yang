        Fabric OS 8.2.0a
        ----------------
          Correction of 'payload' leaf type and pattern

        Fabric OS 8.2.1
        ---------------
          Formatting
          Organization information
          Correction of fraction precision
          Default statement removed
          Naming standard update.

        Fabric OS 9.0.0
        ---------------
          Addition of 'remote-switch-wwn' and 'remote-port-index' leaf
          attributes to 'brocade-fibrechannel-diagnostics' container.
          Updated the 'payload' leaf description.
          Updated link error stats enum values.
          Updated the description for leafs tx,rx,loss,comments in the
          containers egress-power-loss and ingress-power-loss.
          Updated the description for leaf frame-size.
          Added two new leafs to support individual test start and
          estimated time.
          Updated following: leaf 'name' with pattern, leafs 'tx,rc,loss' in the
          containers ingress-power-loss and egress-power-loss with range and
          the typedef 'comments-type' with length, pattern and description.
          Updated length for leaf comments in the containers ingress-power-loss
          and egress-power-loss.
          Updated patterns for the leaf 'name,''start-time' and 'end-time.'

        Fabric OS 9.0.1
        ---------------
          Corrected typos
          Updated pattern for the 'comments' leaf of ingress-power-loss and
          egress-power-loss containers.
          Update pattern for the leaf 'end-time.'

        It refers to Yang module version in the format of x.y.z, where:

        x = the major version number
        y = the minor version number
        z = the patch version number

        Changes to the major version number denote backwards-incompatible
        changes between two versions of a module.

        Changes to the minor version number indicate there are
        backwards-compatible features introduced or changed.

        Changes to the patch version indicate backwards-compatible
        corrections in the module.
